# healthy_stool_97_study_lookup

Internal ID: A101 (previous folder name A101_hstool97_study_lookup)

## Question

This pipeline produces: 26,881,038 study-supported proteins and the 97 pooled prediction files (evidence_lake.stats.json), line 567

Used by: text_statistics/supplementary_methods_1_5.

## Code

The files are copies of the code that produced the used outputs, as it ran. The only change is mechanical: absolute lab paths were replaced by the token `LAB_ROOT` (Python and JSON) or `${FASTALAKE_DATA_DIR}` (shell and Slurm launchers), and personal identifiers were removed. Set `FASTALAKE_DATA_DIR` (inputs) and `FASTALAKE_OUT_DIR` (outputs) and substitute `LAB_ROOT` accordingly to run them. The original locations and sha256 of the unmodified files are in RECEIPTS.md.

| file | what it does (first docstring or comment line of the original) |
|---|---|
| none | no code file is listed in the plan for this analysis; see OPEN_ITEMS.md |

## Inputs

Inputs are named in the original code by `LAB_ROOT` paths (public sequence files, prediction files, search results of upstream pipelines). Their sha256 were not recorded by the original runs; see OPEN_ITEMS.md.

## Outputs

| output | sha256 |
|---|---|
| `evidence_lake.stats.json` | `d96e655e269271c2b0c92bf6d6467db4069a49fe09e170fcaa244e82f4f70d16` |

## Slurm resources and run time

Read from the Slurm accounting database (sacct) for the job ids recorded in RECEIPTS.md.

No job id could be traced for this analysis; see OPEN_ITEMS.md.

## Choices

Values below are the top-level named constants of the code, with the comment written next to them in the original. A blank reason means the original gave none.

| parameter | value | why | alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| none found as top-level constants | | | |
